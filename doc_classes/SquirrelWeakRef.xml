	<description>
		Represents a Squirrel "weakref" object. Points to another Squirrel object ([String] or [SquirrelVariant]), and is automatically changed to wrapping [code]null[/code] if the object is deleted due to being unreferenced.
		[b]Note:[/b] When stored in a container ([SquirrelTable], [SquirrelArray], [SquirrelClass], or [SquirrelInstance]), retrieving it will return the result from [method get_object] automatically.
		[b]Note:[/b] [SquirrelWeakRef] can point to [String], but only if it is created in Squirrel, as [String] does not extend [SquirrelVariant].
